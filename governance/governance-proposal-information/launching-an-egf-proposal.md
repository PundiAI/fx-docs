# Launching an EGF Proposal

Before launching an EGF proposal on-chain, it is important that the proposer adheres to the guidelines found on this [documentation](egf-grants-program.md) or the official [Function X EGF repository](https://github.com/FunctionX/FunctionX-EGF).&#x20;

To launch an EGF proposal, go to [StarScan](https://starscan.io/) and click on the `Proposals` tab and click on `Make Proposal`. Following which, there will be a prompt to connect to a wallet; and after connecting to a wallet, the proposer can proceed to make the proposal.

Fill up the fields in the form with adequate and appropriate details.&#x20;

For EGF proposals, it is CRUCIAL that the `Type` of the proposal is selected as: `Ecosystem Genesis Fund (EGF).`&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Under the `Details` section, the proposer should include a sufficient summary of what the proposal is about, including links to forum discussion(s) and any Github repositories.  For `Recipient Configuration`, the `Address` is the wallet address for receiving the funds, and the `Amount` is the total amount of `FX` requested.

It is important for the proposer to note that the `Initial Deposit` required for an EGF proposal (and any other proposal) is at least `1000 FX` and this will be required to move the proposal into the `Deposit Period`. Once the `min deposit` or the deposit threshold is reached, the proposal will automatically enter the `voting period`. Do note that for EGF proposals, the total deposit amount must be followed according to the current EGF deposit status.

{% hint style="info" %}
The current EGF deposit status can be found [here](egf-info.md)
{% endhint %}

When the proposer is ready to submit the EGF proposal, clicking on `Submit Proposal` will launch a prompt for the proposer to sign the transaction on their connected wallet. Once the transaction is signed, the proposal will be launched.
